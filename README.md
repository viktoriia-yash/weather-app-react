I did this project during the " SheCodes React" course. To create it, I used:<br/>
<ul>
<li>HTML, CSS, and React.js</li>
<li>API from OpenWeatherMap.org</li>
<li>Netlify for hosting</li>
</ul>
The final working result you can find here: <a href="#">Netlify</a> <br/>
My "SheCodes Plus" certificate you can find here: <a href="#">SheCodes</a>
